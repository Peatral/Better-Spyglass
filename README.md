I have struck once again! Use your spyglass from your pocket, inventory offhand, belt slot or whatever you want! Even on forge AND fabric!

But most importantly: While you are spying with your little eye, your friends can actually watch you in multiplayer. Yes, this is seriously my USP.
This mod might have less configurability than other mods you might find but none of them are "immersive" in multiplayer :P
